# Supabase Integration Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for verifying the Supabase integration in the ULIMI system. The integration includes authentication, data storage, and real-time features.

## Test Environment Setup
1. Create a Supabase project
2. Configure environment variables in `.env` file:
   - VITE_SUPABASE_URL
   - VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
3. Run the Supabase schema script to create tables
4. Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies
5. Set up test users with different roles

## Test Cases

### 1. Authentication Tests
- [ ] User registration with email and password
- [ ] User login with valid credentials
- [ ] User login with invalid credentials (should fail)
- [ ] User logout
- [ ] Session persistence across page reloads
- [ ] Role-based access control

### 2. User Management Tests
- [ ] Fetch current user profile
- [ ] Update user profile information
- [ ] User metadata storage and retrieval

### 3. Farm Management Tests
- [ ] Create new farm
- [ ] List user's farms
- [ ] Update farm details
- [ ] Delete farm
- [ ] Farm data validation

### 4. Task Management Tests
- [ ] Create new task
- [ ] List tasks for a farm
- [ ] Update task status
- [ ] Delete task
- [ ] Task assignment to users

### 5. Marketplace Tests
- [ ] List marketplace items
- [ ] Create new marketplace item
- [ ] Update marketplace item
- [ ] Delete marketplace item
- [ ] Place order
- [ ] View order history

### 6. Inventory Tests
- [ ] Add inventory item
- [ ] List inventory items
- [ ] Update inventory item
- [ ] Delete inventory item
- [ ] Inventory quantity tracking

### 7. Data Integration Tests
- [ ] Fetch weather data
- [ ] Fetch satellite data
- [ ] Fetch IoT sensor data
- [ ] Fetch regulatory data
- [ ] Fetch market price data

### 8. Security Tests
- [ ] Row Level Security enforcement
- [ ] Unauthorized access attempts (should be denied)
- [ ] Data isolation between users
- [ ] API key security

### 9. Performance Tests
- [ ] Page load times
- [ ] Database query performance
- [ ] Authentication response times
- [ ] Data synchronization speed

### 10. Error Handling Tests
- [ ] Network error handling
- [ ] Database connection errors
- [ ] Invalid data validation
- [ ] Supabase service outages

## Testing Tools
- Jest for unit tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Supabase CLI for local development
- Postman for API testing

## Test Data
Sample data will be created for each test user:
- Admin user: Mubita
- Farmer user: Mirriam
- Customer user: Natasha
- Vendor user: David Seeds Co.

## Expected Results
All tests should pass with:
- Proper error handling
- Correct data storage and retrieval
- Appropriate access controls
- Good performance metrics

## Rollback Plan
If integration issues are found:
1. Revert to localStorage implementation
2. Fix identified issues
3. Re-run tests
4. Deploy fixed version

## Success Criteria
- All test cases pass
- No critical or high severity issues
- Performance within acceptable limits
- Security requirements met
