# Ulimi Smart Farming System - AI/ML Models Documentation

## Overview

The Ulimi Smart Farming System incorporates several AI/ML models to provide intelligent insights and recommendations to farmers. This document describes the models implemented in the system and their functionality.

## Models Implemented

### 1. Pest and Disease Detection Model

**File**: [ai-models/pest-detection.js](../ai-models/pest-detection.js)

**Purpose**: Identify pests and diseases in crops based on image analysis.

**Functionality**:
- Simulates image analysis to detect common agricultural pests and diseases
- Provides confidence scores for detections
- Generates treatment recommendations based on detected issues
- Supports the following pest/disease types:
  - Aphids
  - Caterpillars
  - Fungal Disease
  - Bacterial Blight
  - Powdery Mildew
  - Rust
  - Healthy (no issues detected)

**Input**: Image data (simulated)
**Output**: 
- Detected pest/disease type
- Confidence score (60-100%)
- Treatment recommendation

**Usage**:
```javascript
import pestDetectionModel from './ai-models/pest-detection';

const result = await pestDetectionModel.analyzeImage(imageData);
console.log(result.detectedPest, result.confidence, result.recommendation);
```

### 2. Recommendation Engine

**File**: [ai-models/recommendation-engine.js](../ai-models/recommendation-engine.js)

**Purpose**: Generate farming recommendations based on sensor data and farm information.

**Functionality**:
- Analyzes sensor data to generate actionable recommendations
- Supports multiple recommendation types:
  - Irrigation scheduling
  - Fertilizer application
  - Pest control measures
  - Harvesting suggestions
  - Planting recommendations
- Prioritizes recommendations (high, medium, low)
- Customizes recommendations based on farm information

**Input**: 
- Sensor data (simulated)
- Farm information (name, crop type, etc.)

**Output**: 
- List of recommendations with types and priorities
- Actionable messages for farmers

**Usage**:
```javascript
import recommendationEngine from './ai-models/recommendation-engine';

const recommendations = recommendationEngine.generateRecommendations(sensorData, farmInfo);
```

### 3. Price Prediction Model

**File**: [ai-models/price-prediction.js](../ai-models/price-prediction.js)

**Purpose**: Predict future market prices for agricultural products.

**Functionality**:
- Forecasts prices for the next 7 days
- Analyzes market trends for different product categories
- Provides market insights and recommendations
- Supports the following categories:
  - Vegetables
  - Fruits
  - Dairy
  - Meat
  - Grains

**Input**: Product category
**Output**: 
- Current price
- 7-day price predictions
- Market trend analysis
- Selling recommendations

**Usage**:
```javascript
import pricePredictionModel from './ai-models/price-prediction';

const priceForecast = pricePredictionModel.predictPrices('vegetables');
const marketInsights = pricePredictionModel.getMarketInsights('vegetables');
```

### 4. Livestock Monitoring Model

**File**: [ai-models/livestock-monitoring.js](../ai-models/livestock-monitoring.js)

**Purpose**: Monitor livestock health and predict breeding cycles.

**Functionality**:
- Analyzes health data to assess animal wellbeing
- Determines health status (healthy, sick, recovering, quarantined)
- Generates health recommendations
- Predicts breeding cycles and optimal conditions
- Supports multiple animal types:
  - Cattle
  - Sheep
  - Goats
  - Pigs
  - Chickens

**Input**: Animal health data (temperature, activity level, etc.)
**Output**: 
- Health score (60-100)
- Health status
- Care recommendations
- Breeding predictions

**Usage**:
```javascript
import livestockMonitoring from './ai-models/livestock-monitoring';

const healthAnalysis = livestockMonitoring.analyzeHealthData(animalData);
const breedingPrediction = livestockMonitoring.predictBreedingCycle(animalData);
```

## Integration with Frontend

The AI/ML models are integrated with the frontend through service layers that simulate API calls. In a production environment, these would be replaced with actual API endpoints that run the models on the server.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real TensorFlow.js Implementation**: Replace simulations with actual TensorFlow.js models
2. **Model Training**: Implement model training capabilities with historical data
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for better accuracy
4. **Real-time Processing**: Process data streams in real-time
5. **Edge Computing**: Deploy models on edge devices for offline functionality

## Model Evaluation

In the current implementation, models use simulated data and randomization to demonstrate functionality. In a production environment, the following evaluation metrics would be used:

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions
- **Precision**: Ratio of true positives to all positive predictions
- **Recall**: Ratio of true positives to all actual positives
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the ROC curve for binary classification

## Data Requirements

For production deployment, the models would require:

1. **Training Data**: Historical data for model training
2. **Validation Data**: Data for model validation and tuning
3. **Real-time Data**: Continuous data streams for predictions
4. **Feedback Data**: User feedback for model improvement

## Privacy and Ethics

- All data processing follows privacy-by-design principles
- Farmers retain ownership of their data
- Models are designed to augment, not replace, farmer expertise
- Recommendations include uncertainty measures
- Regular model auditing for bias and fairness

## Conclusion

The AI/ML models in the Ulimi Smart Farming System provide valuable insights to farmers, helping them make data-driven decisions. While the current implementation uses simulations, the architecture is designed to accommodate real machine learning models with minimal changes to the frontend integration.
