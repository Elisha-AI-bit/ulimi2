### 1. User Management
- Role-based authentication (Farmer, Buyer, Vendor, Admin)
- Registration and login functionality
- Profile management

### 2. Farm Management
- Dashboard with sensor data visualization
- Real-time monitoring of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity
- Farm overview and management

### 3. AI-Powered Recommendations
- Irrigation scheduling
- Fertilizer needs analysis
- Pest and disease detection
- Harvesting suggestions

### 4. Pest & Disease Detection
- Image upload functionality
- AI analysis simulation
- Treatment recommendations

### 5. Livestock Monitoring
- Animal health tracking
- Activity and temperature monitoring
- Health status visualization

### 6. Marketplace
- Product listing for vendors
- Product browsing for buyers
- Shopping cart functionality

### 7. Reporting & Analytics
- Performance reports
- Pest/disease tracking
- Comparative analytics (Admin)
